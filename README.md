# Free Abuse²
___________

Free Abuse 2 is a continuation of the old Free Abuse (fRaBs), an open source Abuse game asset based on the demo of the original game (Abuse) augmented by community scripts and maps, making fRaBs a full-fledged alternative version of the Abuse game created by "Crack Dot Com".

fRaBs² is the continuation of this project. The goal is not to directly continue this game, but to fix the bugs and problems of the original fRaBs version.

Changes:
* Replacement of icons.spe file to make the game work on Xenoveritas/abuse.
* Creation of alternative SFX based on files from FreeDoom and Blasphemer (CREDITS must be described accurately)
* Removing Claudio, i.e. non-free assets
* Replacing bactiles.spe in alien addon with placeholder

## How to install?

* Compile Xenoveritas/abuse
* Download fRaBs²
* Copy abuse and abuse-tool to fRaBs²
* Run the game using
abuse -datadir <CATALOG TO FRABS>
* If you want to run other addons, use the -a parameter (e.g. -a leon).
